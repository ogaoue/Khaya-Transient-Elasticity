# Khaya-Transient-Elasticity
This is a set of R script as supporting document for Gaoue OG (2015). Transient dynamics reveal the importance of early life survival to the response of a tropical plant to harvest. Journal of Applied Ecology, (in press.). 

The script allows users to conduct transient elasticity analysis and compare short- versus long-term dynamics and elasticity patterns. This has been applied to data from African Mahogany (Khaya senegalensis), a tree that is harvested by local people in West Africa for its leaves as source of fodder.
